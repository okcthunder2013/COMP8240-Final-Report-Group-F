Overview

This project demonstrates text pre-processing and preparation for an IMDB movie review dataset. It includes scripts and data files essential for processing and analysing movie reviews.


Project Files

"solution.ipynb": A Jupyter Notebook that contains code and explanations for processing the IMDB movie dataset and performing analysis tasks.

"Preprocess.py": A Python script that pre-processes the IMDB dataset by applying various text transformations, preparing it for classification and further analysis.

"IMDB Dataset.csv": A CSV file containing movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. This raw data is used for text classification and pre-processing tasks.

"train.txt": A text file with pre-processed training data, derived from IMDB Dataset.csv.
"test.txt": A text file with pre-processed test data, also derived from the IMDB dataset.

Workflow

Run "Preprocess.py": Execute this script to process IMDB Dataset.csv, transforming raw text data into a structured format.

Training and Testing Files: The processed data is saved as train.txt and test.txt, which can then be used for model training and evaluation.

Usage

Load "solution.ipynb" in GitHub Codespaces to view the code examples and run analyses on the IMDB dataset.

Use "Preprocess.py" to prepare the dataset, generating train.txt and test.txt for training and testing purposes.
